		2.a. When a new sale is entered it needs to effect the inventory at the facility that sold the product and effect the available item quantity at that facility.
3. Whenever a new Item is added to the Item Datatable it needs to update all the facilities to reflect the additional item.
4. Need a page for transferring inventory from one facility to another.
5. Need a page for Listing all available individual instances of an item at each facility to get a total available for that item.
6. Multiple levels of access:
